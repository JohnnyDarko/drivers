# drivers:
Drivers are the underlying mechanics that interact directly with hardware or bridge disimilar systems or networks.

Combined with nodes, in most cases together they represent the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

example of drivers:

    Serial based driver to pull nmea sentences from gps
    i2c based driver to communicate with barometer
    i2c based driver to communicate with gyroscope
    i2c based driver to communicates with accelerometer
